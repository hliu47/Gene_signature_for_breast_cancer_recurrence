# Subtype Specific and RNA-Seq Based Gene Signatures for the Prediction of Breast Cancer Recurrence
#### 1. Modeled and analyzed RNA-Seq data with over 1,000 patients and over 50,000 transcripts.
#### 2. Developed a novel statistical classification method that can properly handle high-dimensional problems.
#### 3. Developed and validated specific gene signatures for the prognosis of breast cancer recurrence.
